# Cozmo Code for HRI Lab
[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/terraform-docs/terraform-docs)](https://github.com/ewhenry/cozmo-lab-assistant/blob/master/LICENSE)

This is a Python library for transcribing real-time communication from the user and using GPT3.5-Turbo to generate responses from the assistant.

## Notes

- Cozmo's API only works with Python 3.9

## Instalization

You can fork this repo to build off of it, or download it if you must.

## Usage

No proper .exe or application front end, merely execute the app.py file (Python 3.9) and start interacting.

## TODO

- [] support compatability with NAO, a more serious unit
- [] build an app front-end
- [] find a way to speed up the response time, perhaps drop GPT3.5 or use a websocket to a fast computer
